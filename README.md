### 1.1 Product scope
The application allows users to locate specific mathematics and statistics theses as a mini-search engine without physically engaging in a library search. The goal is for the app to help students in simplifying the process of searching specific theses quickly. 

### 1.2 Product value
In the field of research, the rise of a new study is made possible through an interface of a variety of related studies, thus the need for references on related literature/studies. In the process of searching, engaging oneself physically in searching related studies in the library takes time and may cause inconvenience to others especially when unsure of what specific information of the study is to be searched, it might as well when surfing the World Wide Web as it offers a wider array of choices internationally-based. The application’s utility is in value to the user’s time and convenience. It helps the user to search on specific Mathematics and Statistics theses work quickly providing a list of results, with the user’s accessibility anytime and anywhere the user wants.

### 1.3 Intended audience
The application is intended to help MSU-IIT users (including different colleges) who seek to search for references or specific Mathematics and Statistics theses works. The application is exclusive only to users within MSU-IIT and shall be accessed locally.

### 1.4 Intended use
The application as a mini-search engine helps the user in search for specific theses works, then provides right after the list of related Mathematics and Statistics theses works.

### 1.5 General description
The DMS (Department of Mathematics and Statistics) mini-search engine is an application that allows users to input a free keyword in search for related or specific Mathematics and Statistics theses works. The application then provides a list of these theses references ranked in accordance with the frequency of the searched keyword. The application output will be the list of these theses works in the form of a “document-term matrix”, wherein the rows are the lists of the theses works, while the columns show the count on how frequently the keyword appeared in the theses work, thesis title, author, theses levels of education (Bachelor’s degree, Master’s degree, and Doctorate degree), and subject classification (Mathematics or Statistics).  The application also provides contact information on whom to reach out in accessing the specific thesis the user wants to view/access.
